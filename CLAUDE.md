# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance for AI assistants working with the Integrated Github Applications repository.

## Project Overview

Integrated Github Applications is a newly initialized project. The repository is currently in a skeleton state with no application code, dependencies, or build configuration yet established.

## Repository Structure

```

└── .git/            # Git version control
```

No source directories, configuration files, or dependencies exist yet. This project requires bootstrapping before development can begin.

## Development Setup

No setup steps are currently required as the project has no dependencies or build system.

When the project is bootstrapped, update this section with:
- Required runtime (Node.js, Python, etc.) and version
- Dependency installation commands
- Environment variable configuration
- Local development server commands

## Build / Test / Lint Commands

None configured yet. Update this section as tooling is added:
- **Build:** _not configured_
- **Test (all):** _not configured_
- **Test (single):** _not configured_
- **Lint:** _not configured_
- **Format:** _not configured_

## Code Conventions

No conventions are established yet. When code is added, document:
- Language and framework choices
- File and directory naming conventions
- Import ordering and module organization
- Error handling patterns
- Typing / type-checking approach

## Git Workflow

- **Main branch:** the default branch (currently unnamed/master)
- **Feature branches:** use `claude/` prefix for AI-assisted development
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change

## Key Architectural Decisions

None yet. Record significant design choices here as the project evolves.

## Environment Variables

None required yet. When added, list them here with descriptions (never commit actual secrets).
